# new file1 causes the rm file1 to not assume file1 exists thus not adding it to precondition
new file1
rm file1

new file1
rm file1

# this command works now but should not work because file1 should not exist or be assumed to exist
# it works because we aren't asserting that file1 does not exist when we execute the first command
rm file1
